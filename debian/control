Description: Displaying the graphical console of a virtual machine
 The console is accessed using the VNC or SPICE protocol. The guest can be
 referred to based on its name, ID, or UUID. If the guest is not already
 running, then the viewer can be told to wait until is starts before attempting
 to connect to the console The viewer can connect to remote hosts to lookup the
 console information and then also connect to the remote console using the same
 network transport.
